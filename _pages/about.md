Hi! My name is Jordan Duffin Wong and I'm a 4th-year Ph.D student in the Department of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I am also a survey research affiliate with the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy.

My Research
======
I study the politics and space of the rural United States. My dissertation is called **Here Come the Vultures: How Our Politics Shape Death (and What Comes After)**. It can be summarized as follows:

<i>Death is a universal experience: astonishingly personal, yet heavily regulated by government. Ample social science research studies how states exert power over death, from policies such as abortion and capital punishment to the promotion of public health. However, that research emphasizes the state's role in events <u>leading up to death</u> at the expense of overlooking its role in death practices, or <u>what is done with bodies after death</u>. This dissertation explores the latter: I argue that our political dispositions inform our preferences for what is done with bodies after death and that those dispositions manifest themselves in the death practices we choose to construct, maintain, or discard. By thinking about the administration of death as a political problem, I conceptualize local government as the solution to that problem. From there, I predict that heterogeneous beliefs about the role of local government map onto divergent preferences for how local government should (or shouldn't) administer death. These preferences manifest in <u>what</u> death practices are legal or socially desirable, <u>who</u> is allowed to administer them, and <u>where</u> they are enacted.</i>

<!--My dissertation, in its early stages, is called <b>Is Idyll Ideal? The Politics of Space, Rurality, and Remoteness in the United States</b>. It can be summarized as follows:

<i>How do citizens think about space and government? From technical or policy questions such as "how do political motivations impact land management?" to conceptual questions such as "what does it mean to be rural or remote?", this dissertation grapples with how space -- particularly distance between places -- changes the way that Americans interact with government. Using a variety of methods from Political Science, Human Geography, and other disciplines, this dissertation investigates questions including:</i>
- <i>How do existing theories of the relationship between citizens and government change when one is distant? Insofar as citizens and politicians still have some sort of policy preference/incentive, can they still make sensible decisions without the other?</i>
- <i>What is the theoretical difference between "rurality" and "remoteness"? What implications does this difference have for how we construct the relationship between citizens and government? How might we better operationalize and measure it?</i>
- <i>How does politics change when places depopulate? When primarily rural places empty out, what happens to the few that remain? In the most extreme instances, how does government exist when the population becomes zero? In other words, how do you govern a ghost town?</i>
- <i>Access to broadband internet has transformed the United States, integrating economic and social networks more than ever. However, the development of broadband infrastructure in rural places has been staggered, costly, and uneven. How do those differences in broadband access condition political attitudes and behavior?</i>
- <i>"Land doesn't vote, but people do." However, vast swathes of unpopulated land in the United States are under government jurisdiction. How do we think about public land use and administration when no one lives or works there?</i>
